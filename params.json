{"name":"RxBotics","tagline":"Robotic controller frameworkusing RxJS","body":"### Welcome to RxBotics\r\n\r\nIt has only just begun but the dream is to create a fully functioning robotics controller framework using nothing but Javascript. This framework is initially going to be designed to work with [Bonescript](https://github.com/jadonk/bonescript) for the [BeagleBone Black](http://beagleboard.org/black), but who knows what the future may hold!\r\n\r\nThere is a wonderful course [Control of Mobile Robots](https://www.coursera.org/course/conrob) which has inspired me along this path, I recommend anyone interested to take a look. There is also instructions in that course on how to make a robot to use this framework with.\r\n\r\nThis is early days, but watch this space!","google":"UA-63991234-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
